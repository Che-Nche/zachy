            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            "IDA is an extremely important instrument for African countries and for developing nations
             as a whole because of the types of loans that are made available to our States." <br>
             (MACKY SALL, President of Senegal, July 17, 2021)<br><br>
             The World Bank Group is made up of IDA (International Development Association) and (IBRD) 
             International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In this project, I focused on IDA 
             which is aimed at lending funds to developing nations with little or no service charge rates 
             to aid projects that have direct socio-economic effects to the nations. I have always had the 
             notion that Cameroon was one of the top borrowers from IDA and heavily indebted but I was 
             astonished when I found out that other countries, I thought were better positioned had more 
             loans such as Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya. Etc.<br><br>
             In this project emphasis was on Cameroon because it is my country of birth and I found it 
             interesting to dig deep into their financial transactions with The World Bank and to clear some 
             of the doubts I had. I decided to do a comparative study to get a clearer understanding of the 
             picture. In this regard, Senegal was chosen with approximately the same per capita income like 
             Cameroon to do the comparative study. <br><br>
             For a country to secure a loan (grant) from IDA, that country had to have a good record in management 
             of the country as well as credits and grants received for IDA projects. IDA has a number of criteria 
             for a country to meet before a loan can be granted, and one of them is that the said country must 
             have a per capita income below their cut-off threshold. All developing countries are below the limit 
             and this explains why IDA give grants only to them. The duration of each credit depends on the 
             socio-economic size of the country and it ranges from 30, 38 or 40 years. <br><br>

            <h3>The Dataset</h3>
            Working with this type of high-volume data, it is sometimes cumbersome, time consuming, needs high-functional 
            computer, and prone to making errors that can be avoided if working with a smaller data set. In order to 
            narrow down or filter the data, I used PostgreSQL to query the data to get the desired rows and columns for 
            analysis.  The dataset can be found here and it is made up of 1.2 million rows and 30 columns and was last 
            updated on the 17th, March 2023.

            Despite numerous other institutions where developing countries can borrow funds from, they find the World Bank 
            a safe heaven. The interest rate is relatively low with an average of 0.7827 and most or all developing 
            countries found it easy to meet the terms of loan approval. <br><br>

            <img src="devpics/Picture21.png" alt="finance" width="100%"> <br><br>
            After getting an overview of the data, I went further to select the top countries due to IDA.  This was because 
            I wanted to find out if Cameroon was among. To my greatest dismay India happened to be top on the list due to IDA 
            with $793,256,127.6 followed by Kenya with $780,555,197.6 and Cameroon did not appear on the list. <br><br>
            <img src="devpics/Picture22.png" alt="finance" width="100%">
            <img src="devpics/Picture23.png" alt="finance" width="100%"> <br><br>
            Cameroon has carried out numerous projects ranging from small to giant ones and according to the results, it has 
            a total of 14,063 projects executed or in process thanks to credit and grants form IDA. <br><br>
            <img src="devpics/Picture24.png" alt="finance" width="100%">
            <img src="devpics/Picture25.png" alt="finance" width="100%"> <br><br>
            A further breakdown of this number into the various stages (Credit Status) of the credit and grant stages gave the 
            following numbers;<br><br>
            <img src="devpics/Picture26.png" alt="finance" width="100%">
            <img src="devpics/Picture27.png" alt="finance" width="100%"> <br><br>
            Amongst the projects, I decided to look at where the largest portion of this money went to. I did not 
            only look for the maximum funded project but also went further to write a query to get the top 10 projects in 
            descending order. The project with the highest amount was the Cameroon-Chad Transport Corridor with an amount of 
            $313,000,000 followed by Logorc (LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND RESILIENT COMMUNITIES) project.<br><br>
            <img src="devpics/Picture28.png" alt="finance" width="100%">
            <img src="devpics/Picture29.png" alt="finance" width="100%"> <br><br>
            After getting the most expensive project, I was a bit curious to know which were the least. The project with the least 
            amount was CAISSE AUTONONOME D’AMORTISSEMENT (Autonomous Sinking Fund) costing $550,000 followed by $778,448.2 for the 
            Douala infrastructure for the fiscal year 2003 borrowed by MINISTERE DES INVESTISSEMENT PUBLIQUES (Ministry of Public Investments)<br><br>
            <img src="devpics/Picture30.png" alt="finance" width="100%">
            <img src="devpics/Picture31.png" alt="finance" width="100%"> <br><br>
            In the course of my analysis, I realised that we can’t be dwelling on other aspects of the transactions without knowing the 
            debt situation of the country. To do this, I decided to get a sum of the Original Principal Amount which stands 
            at $501,666,922,983.9 <br><br>
            <img src="devpics/Picture32.png" alt="finance" width="100%">
            <img src="devpics/Picture33.png" alt="finance" width="100%"> <br><br>
            In the same way I got the Total Amount Due to IDA (debt) as $149,225,026,293<br><br>
            <img src="devpics/Picture34.png" alt="finance" width="100%">
            <img src="devpics/Picture35.png" alt="finance" width="100%"> <br><br>
            These two figures give us an understanding of the financial situation of Cameroon towards IDA. If we do a simple calculation, we 
            realise that the total amount Due to IDA is approximately 30% excluding service charge rate. It is not included in the calculation 
            because the rates are varied.<br> 
            Despite being a debtor, the country still borrows a lot of money. Below were some of the most recent credits with some in the process 
            of disbursing and others pending disbursement. <br><br>
            <img src="devpics/Picture36.png" alt="finance" width="100%">
            <img src="devpics/Picture37.png" alt="finance" width="100%"> <br><br>
            I earlier mentioned that I shall do my analysis and compare with Senegal since they have similar GDP. The total Original Principal 
            Amount for Senegal is $754,000,512,142.6.  If you go back to the result showing sum of Original Principal Amount borrowed by Cameroon, 
            you will notice that Senegal has borrowed $252,333,589,158.7 more than Cameroon. <br><br>
            <img src="devpics/Picture38.png" alt="finance" width="100%">
            <img src="devpics/Picture39.png" alt="finance" width="100%"> <br><br>
            Senegal’s total debt due to IDA almost doubled that of Cameroon. A simple arithmetic was done to get the difference in amount. 
            $293872937245.3 -$149,225,026,293 = $144,647,910,952.3 <br><br>
            <img src="devpics/Picture40.png" alt="finance" width="100%">
            <img src="devpics/Picture41.png" alt="finance" width="100%"> <br><br>
            Senegal has submitted 26919 applications for grants and credits and not all were approved. Cameroon on the other had 14063 applications. 
            From these number of applications from both countries, it is evident that Senegal applied for 12856 more credits and grants than Cameroon. <br><br>
            <img src="devpics/Picture42.png" alt="finance" width="100%">
            <img src="devpics/Picture43.png" alt="finance" width="100%"> <br><br>
            But this figure did not tell us the status of the applications. In order to get a clearer understanding of the figure, I wrote a query to get the 
            Credit Status of the country. It was noticed that 10,700 credits had fully been paid and 332 approved pending disbursement in the case of Senegal. <br><br>
            <img src="devpics/Picture44.png" alt="finance" width="100%">
            <img src="devpics/Picture45.png" alt="finance" width="100%"> <br><br>
            The table below depicts an overview of five countries and some of the attributes to gauge their engagements with IDA. Amongst them, Nigeria has the 
            highest service charge rate and the least is Senegal. Furthermore, the total sum of credit if arranged in descending order puts Nigeria on, the top 
            followed by Kenya, Ghana, Senegal and Cameroon.<br><br>
            <img src="devpics/Picture46.png" alt="finance" width="100%">
            <img src="devpics/Picture47.png" alt="finance" width="100%"> <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Recommendations and more findings</h3>
            Summarily, Cameroon has got little fundings from IDA as compared to these randomly selected developing countries (See query).  A country like Nigeria 
            had a total credit and grants of more than a trillion dollars and with a fewer number of projects. This indicated that the number of projects with 
            grants or credit from IDA was not proportional to the borrowed amount.<br><br>
            The service charge rate differs from country to country and ranges from zero to a maximum of 6.52 as of 17/03/2023 when the data was last updated.  
            More findings should be carried out to ascertain the reasons for the disparity.<br><br>
